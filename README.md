### Oh, hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sebastien, a software engineer from the Great White North. I have a long experience working with startups, and I've 
had the chance to work on a wide variety of projects.

I am also an educator, teaching one-on-one, and writing [articles](https://dev.to/sebastienfilion) and filming videos 
for my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/sebastienfilion87) on things like Web APIs, Web standards,
[Functional Programming](https://github.com/functionalland) concepts ðŸ“¦ and [Deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno) ðŸ¦•.

If you came accross some of my work and it was useful to you, you might have had that itch to sponsor me... 
I accept one-time or monthly donations on [my GitHub Sponsor page](https://github.com/sponsors/sebastienfilion).
