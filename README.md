### Hey ðŸ‘‹

Hey! I'm a software engineer from the Great White North. I have a long experience working with startups, and I've had 
the chance to work on a wide variety of projects.
Nowadays, I spend most of my time collaborating on open-source projects, mentoring and experimenting with 
[Functional Programming](https://github.com/sebastienfilion/functional) concepts ðŸ“¦ and 
[Deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno) ðŸ¦•.

I am also the creator of [Nucleus](https://github.com/idexlabs/idex.nucleus.core) a framework that makes 
micro-architecture inter-instance communication a breeze.
